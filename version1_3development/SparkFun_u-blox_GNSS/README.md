u-blox makes some incredible GNSS receivers covering everything from low-cost, highly configurable modules such as the SAM-M8Q all the way up to the surveyor grade ZED-F9P with precision of the diameter of a dime. This library focuses on configuration and control of u-blox devices over I<sup>2</sup>C (called DDC by u-blox) and Serial. The UBX protocol is supported over both I<sup>2</sup>C and serial, and is a much easier and lighterweight interface to a GNSS module. Stop polling messages and parsing NMEA data! Simply ask for the datums you need and receive an automatic callback when they arrive.

This library can be installed via the Arduino Library manager. Search for **SparkFun u-blox GNSS**.

## v2.0

This library is the new and improved version of the very popular SparkFun u-blox GNSS Arduino Library. v2.0 contains some big changes and improvements:

* Seamless support for "automatic" message delivery:
  * In v1.8, you could ask for the NAV PVT (Navigation Position Velocity Time) message to be delivered _automatically_, without polling. v2.0 adds automatic support for [**23 messages**](./Theory.md#auto-messages), covering the full range of: standard and High Precision position, velocity and time information; relative positioning; event capture with nanosecond time resolution; raw GNSS signal data including carrier phase; Sensor Fusion; and High Navigation Rate data.
* Dynamic memory allocation with clearly-defined data storage structs for each message:
  * There are no static 'global' variables to eat up your RAM. v2.0 automatically allocates memory for the automatic messages when they are enabled. You may find your total RAM use is lower with v2.0 than with v1.8.
  * Each "auto" message has a clearly-defined [data storage struct](./src/u-blox_structs.h) which follows the u-blox protocol specification precisely.
* Callbacks:
  * No more polling! Simply request the "auto" messages you need and receive an automatic callback when each message arrives.
  * Please see the [callback examples](./examples/Callbacks) for more details.
* Built-in support for data logging:
  * Want to log RXM SFRBX and RAWX data for Post-Processed Kinematics or Precise Point Positioning? You can absolutely do that! v2.0 provides built-in support for data logging, allowing you to log **any** of the "auto" messages simply and easily.
  * Incoming "auto" data can be stored in a configurable ring buffer. You can then extract the data from the buffer and write it to (e.g.) SD card using your favorite SD library.
  * Data is logged in u-blox UBX format which is compact and efficient. You can replay the data using [u-center](https://www.u-blox.com/en/product/u-center).
  * Please see the [data logging examples](./examples/Data_Logging) for more details.

## Migrating to v2.0

Migrating to v2.0 is easy. There are two small changes all users will need to make:

* The name of the library class has changed from ```SFE_UBLOX_GPS``` to ```SFE_UBLOX_GNSS``` to reflect that the library supports all of the Global Navigation Satellite Systems:
  * As a minimum, you need to change: ```SFE_UBLOX_GPS myGPS;```
  * to: ```SFE_UBLOX_GNSS myGPS;```
  * But we would encourage you to use ```SFE_UBLOX_GNSS myGNSS;```. You will see that all of the library examples now use ```myGNSS``` instead of ```myGPS```.
* The name of the library header and C++ files have changed too:
  * Change: ```#include <SparkFun_Ublox_Arduino_Library.h>```
  * to: ```#include <SparkFun_u-blox_GNSS_Arduino_Library.h>```

If you are using the Dead Reckoning Sensor Fusion or High Dynamic Rate messages, you will need to make more small changes to your code. Please see the [dead reckoning examples](./examples/Dead_Reckoning) for more details. There is more detail available in [Theory.md](./Theory.md#migrating-your-code-to-v20) if you need it.

## Max (400kHz) I<sup>2</sup>C Support

To achieve 400kHz I<sup>2</sup>C speed please be sure to remove all pull-ups on the I<sup>2</sup>C bus. Most, if not all, u-blox modules include internal pull ups on the I<sup>2</sup>C lines (sometimes called DDC in their manuals). Cut all I<sup>2</sup>C pull up jumpers and/or remove them from peripheral boards. Otherwise, various data glitches can occur. See issues [38](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_Ublox_Arduino_Library/issues/38) and [40](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_Ublox_Arduino_Library/issues/40) for more information. If possible, run the I<sup>2</sup>C bus at 100kHz.
