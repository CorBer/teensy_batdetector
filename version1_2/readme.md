HEX FILES are provided to allow easy installing (see https://github.com/CorBer/teensy_batdetector/tree/master/version1_2/HEX)

Sourcecode and libraries can be found in the src and lib directory.

This version only uses a very small group of local (non-default) libraries
- USDFS.zip from WMXZ original source at https://github.com/WMXZ-EU/uSDFS
- TimeAltLib.zip (ONLY for windows users !)
and a small group of local libraries. These local libraries can be placed either in your source directory
or in a special "libraries" directory depending on your programming environment.
