V1_2 release

    This is the 2nd release of TeensyBat (202105xx)
    
    The sourcecode/libraries and HEX files have large changes. All code is based on TeensyDuino 1.154.0-beta7 default cores and libraries (https://forum.pjrc.com/threads/66357-Teensyduino-1-54-Beta-7)
    
    This version only uses a very small group of local (non-default) libraries
    - USDFS.zip from WMXZ original source at https://github.com/WMXZ-EU/uSDFS
    and a small group of local libraries. These local libraries can be placed either in your source directory
    or in a special "libraries" directory depending on your programming environment.
