V1_2 release

This is the 2nd release of TeensyBat (20210522)
    
The sourcecode/libraries and HEX files have large changes compared to previous versions. 
All code is based on <b>TeensyDuino 1.154.0-beta7</b> default cores and libraries (https://forum.pjrc.com/threads/66357-Teensyduino-1-54-Beta-7)

This version only uses a very small group of local (non-default) libraries
- USDFS.zip from WMXZ original source at https://github.com/WMXZ-EU/uSDFS
and a small group of local libraries. These local libraries can be placed either in your source directory
or in a special "libraries" directory depending on your programming environment.
