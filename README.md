# update pending (2022 10 18)
<i> Based on some bug-reports and a few hardware-changes (batterymonitor) we will be releasing a new set of HEX-files and sourcecode for TeensyBat 1.4 beta 1
<br>
<b>
# update released after a bug-report (2022 04 16)
<i> About a week ago we got a bug-report that pointed towards an issue for both the T36 and the T41 versions
  of the teensybat using AutoRecord. When stopping the autorecord sequence manually with the recording active this could lead to a wav-file with a wrong header. Also the sample-rate after stopping autorecord was not as the user had set it. We have uploaded source and HEX files for V1.31 
</i>

# BUG in SPARKFUN GPS library
Beginning march 2022 a bug was found in the GPS readout, it seems the sparkfun library had a bug that reported 2022 as a leapyear. The library for teensybat has been updated and the bat_gps.h file is updated.

Repository is available with all recent code and libraries. 

<i>This is a work in progress project, the code will keep changing. If you have a specific request or otherwise questions please share them on the forum. 

For each version you will find a src-directory containing all current sourcecode, several specific libraries have been added to lib-directory for each version. 

I am using a non-default programming setup for Teensy. My primary setup is that I am on Linux Mint 19.3 and I use Microsoft VisualCode as my programming editor (IDE) with the PlatformIO plugin. Pre_compiled_hex files made on my machine can be found on the various versions.</i>
