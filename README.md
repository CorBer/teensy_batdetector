# Teensy_Batdetector  (update 2023 01 25)

## <b>GRANULAR STRETCH</b>
In previous releases we used the acronym "TE" for one of our special modes of the detector. One of the producers of commercial detectors has objected to us using that acronym as they have a patent on the live TE technique. We therefore have renamed the mode to GS, Granular Stretch as this is the actual method we are usign based on the standard granular-effect library in the Teensy Audio library. 

All previous releases are therefore NOT available anymore as converting all of them to respect this demand would mean a lot of work.
