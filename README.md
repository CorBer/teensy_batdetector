<i>This is a work in progress project, the code will keep changing. If you have a specific request or otherwise questions please share them on the forum. 

For each version you will find a src-directory containing all current sourcecode, several specific libraries have been added to lib-directory for each version.

I am using a non-default programming setup for Teensy. My primary setup is that I am on Linux Mint 19.3 and I use Microsoft VisualCode as my programming editor (IDE) with the PlatformIO plugin. Pre_compiled_hex files made on my machine can be found on the various versions.</i>
